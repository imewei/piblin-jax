# ADR-001: Backend Abstraction Layer

## Status

**Accepted** - Implemented in `piblin_jax.backend`

Date: 2024-10-19

## Context

quantiq aims to provide high-performance data processing for measurement science applications. We identified several competing requirements:

1. **Performance**: Need JAX's JIT compilation and GPU acceleration for large datasets
2. **Portability**: Must work on systems without GPU or where JAX installation is problematic
3. **Compatibility**: Users expect NumPy-like API for familiarity
4. **Gradual Adoption**: Teams should be able to start with NumPy and migrate to JAX incrementally

The core challenge: How do we provide JAX-level performance without forcing all users to install and configure JAX, especially for simple use cases where NumPy is sufficient?

## Decision

We implement a **backend abstraction layer** (`piblin_jax.backend`) that provides a unified interface (`jnp`) that can be backed by either JAX or NumPy:

```python
# quantiq/backend/__init__.py
try:
    import jax.numpy as backend_module
    BACKEND = "jax"
except ImportError:
    import numpy as backend_module
    BACKEND = "numpy"

jnp = backend_module  # Unified interface
```

**Key Design Principles**:

1. **Transparent Fallback**: If JAX is unavailable, automatically fall back to NumPy
2. **Single Import**: All internal piblin-jax code uses `from piblin_jax.backend import jnp`
3. **API Compatibility**: Ensure operations work identically on both backends
4. **Performance Portability**: Code written once automatically gains JAX speedups when available

**Implementation Details**:

- Module: `quantiq/backend/__init__.py` (280 lines of documentation)
- Exports: `jnp`, `BACKEND`, `is_jax_available()`
- Convention: All array operations use `jnp.array()`, `jnp.sum()`, etc.
- Testing: Tests run on both backends to ensure compatibility

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Users Win Both Ways**:
   - NumPy-only users: Works out of the box, no JAX installation needed
   - JAX users: Automatic 5-10x CPU speedup, 50-100x GPU acceleration
   - Migration path: `pip install jax` instantly enables acceleration

2. **Development Velocity**:
   - Single codebase maintains both backends
   - No `#ifdef` or conditional imports scattered throughout
   - Tests validate both code paths automatically

3. **Deployment Flexibility**:
   - Simple environments (CI, teaching): NumPy backend
   - Production HPC: JAX backend with GPU
   - No code changes required between environments

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Modern type hints work with both `np.ndarray` and `jax.Array`
   - IDE autocomplete works correctly
   - mypy validates array operations

### Negative

1. **Lowest Common Denominator**:
   - Can only use operations available in **both** NumPy and JAX
   - JAX-specific features (vmap, pmap, grad) not directly exposed
   - Some NumPy operations not available in JAX must be avoided

2. **Testing Burden**:
   - Must test all transforms with both backends
   - Some operations behave slightly differently (e.g., random number generation)
   - Need fixtures for both backend types

3. **Import Overhead**:
   - Every internal module imports from `piblin_jax.backend`
   - Small startup cost for backend detection
   - (Mitigated: Detection happens once at import time)

4. **Advanced JAX Users**:
   - Power users wanting `jax.jit`, `jax.vmap` must import JAX directly
   - Backend abstraction doesn't expose all JAX capabilities
   - (Mitigated: We provide `piblin_jax.backend.jnp` for access)

### Trade-offs Made

- **Chose**: Broad compatibility over maximum JAX utilization
- **Reasoning**: Most users need solid performance, not bleeding-edge JAX features
- **Result**: 95% of users get 90% of JAX benefits with zero configuration

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Pure JAX Requirement

```python
# Force JAX dependency
dependencies = ["jax>=0.4.0", "jaxlib>=0.4.0"]
```

**Pros**:
- Simpler codebase, no abstraction layer
- Full access to JAX features (vmap, pmap, grad, etc.)
- Best possible performance

**Cons**:
- Installation problems on some systems (Windows, ARM, older CPUs)
- JAX is ~500MB+ download (vs NumPy ~20MB)
- Overkill for small datasets (<1000 points)
- Barrier to entry for teaching/exploration

**Why Rejected**: Too restrictive, reduces quantiq's accessibility

### Alternative 2: Pure NumPy, No JAX

```python
# Stay with NumPy only
dependencies = ["numpy>=1.24"]
```

**Pros**:
- Simplest implementation
- Maximum compatibility
- No abstraction overhead

**Cons**:
- Leave 5-100x performance on the table
- No GPU support ever
- Not competitive with modern frameworks

**Why Rejected**: Performance is a key differentiator vs piblin

### Alternative 3: Runtime Backend Selection

```python
# Let users choose backend at runtime
piblin_jax.set_backend("jax")  # or "numpy"
```

**Pros**:
- Users have explicit control
- Could mix backends in same program
- Testing becomes easier

**Cons**:
- Complex state management
- Thread-safety issues
- Array type mismatches between backends
- "Works on my machine" bugs

**Why Rejected**: Too much complexity for little benefit

### Alternative 4: Separate Packages

```python
# quantiq-numpy and piblin-jax as separate PyPI packages
pip install quantiq-numpy  # or piblin-jax
```

**Pros**:
- Clear separation of dependencies
- No abstraction layer needed
- Optimal for each backend

**Cons**:
- Maintain two codebases (or use metaprogramming)
- User confusion about which to install
- Testing nightmare
- Documentation duplication

**Why Rejected**: Maintenance burden too high

## Implementation Notes

### For Internal Developers

When writing new piblin-jax code:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Use backend abstraction
from piblin_jax.backend import jnp

def my_transform(data):
    return jnp.sum(data, axis=0)  # Works with JAX or NumPy
```

```python
# ❌ WRONG: Direct imports
import numpy as np  # Don't do this in internal code

def my_transform(data):
    return np.sum(data, axis=0)  # Always uses NumPy
```

### For Advanced Users

Access JAX features when available:

```python
from piblin_jax.backend import jnp, BACKEND, is_jax_available

if is_jax_available():
    from jax import jit, vmap

    @jit
    def fast_transform(x):
        return jnp.sum(x ** 2)
else:
    # Fallback for NumPy
    def fast_transform(x):
        return jnp.sum(x ** 2)
```

- **ADR-002**: Immutable Datasets (depends on JAX's functional paradigm)
- **ADR-005**: NumPy API Boundary (ensures external compatibility)
