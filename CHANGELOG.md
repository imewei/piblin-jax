## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.2] - 2025-10-23

### Changed
- **Minor workflow improvements**: Internal release workflow optimizations

### Summary
Patch release with minor internal improvements to the release process.

## [0.0.1] - 2025-10-23

### Summary

Initial pre-release of **piblin-jax** - a modern JAX-powered framework for measurement data science. This release provides a complete reimplementation of [piblin](https://github.com/3mcloud/piblin) with dramatic performance improvements (5-10x CPU, 50-100x GPU), advanced Bayesian inference capabilities, and 100% backward compatibility.

**Status**: Pre-release version for testing and evaluation. The API is stable but not yet considered production-ready.

**Repository**: The GitHub repository has been renamed to `piblin-jax` to avoid name conflicts.

**Package Name**: Changed from `quantiq` to `piblin-jax` on PyPI due to existing package with same name. The Python import name remains `quantiq` for backward compatibility.

### Changed
- **Repository Rename**: GitHub repository renamed from `quantiq` to `piblin-jax`
  - Repository URL: https://github.com/piblin/piblin-jax
- **Package Name Change**: PyPI package name changed from `quantiq` to `piblin-jax`
  - Reason: Name `quantiq` already taken on PyPI by another project
  - Installation: `pip install piblin-jax` (was: `pip install quantiq`)
  - Import name unchanged: `import piblin_jax` still works
  - No code changes required for users (only installation command changes)
- **BREAKING:** Removed `gpu-cuda` optional dependency extra from pyproject.toml
  - GPU installation now requires explicit manual installation or `make install-gpu-cuda`
  - Reason: pip extras are unreliable for mutually exclusive dependency variants (CPU vs GPU jaxlib)
  - Migration path: Use `make install-gpu-cuda` (recommended) or manual installation (see README)
  - This eliminates silent CPU/GPU jaxlib conflicts across all package managers
- **JAX Version Constraint**: Updated to `jax>=0.8.0,<0.9.0` for stability
  - Allows bugfix releases within 0.8.x
  - Blocks potentially breaking changes in 0.9.0+
  - GPU installation uses same constraint for consistency

### Improved
- **GPU Installation Reliability**: Enhanced Makefile with automatic package manager detection
  - Automatically detects and uses uv, conda/mamba, or pip
  - Platform validation with clear error messages for macOS/Windows
  - 4-step installation process with progress indicators
  - Automated GPU verification after installation
  - Comprehensive troubleshooting guidance on failure
- **GPU Documentation**: Complete README restructuring for clarity
  - Makefile installation prominently featured as recommended method
  - Clear explanation of why CPU JAX must be uninstalled first
  - Expanded troubleshooting section with common issues
