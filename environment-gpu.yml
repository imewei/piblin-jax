# Conda/Mamba Environment for quantiq with GPU Support
# ========================================================
#
# This environment file installs quantiq with GPU acceleration support.
#
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Linux operating system
# - NVIDIA GPU with CUDA Compute Capability 7.5 or newer
# - CUDA 12.1+ installed on the system
# - conda or mamba package manager
#
# INSTALLATION:
#
#   Using conda:
#     conda env create -f environment-gpu.yml
#     conda activate quantiq-gpu
#
#   Using mamba (faster):
#     mamba env create -f environment-gpu.yml
#     mamba activate quantiq-gpu
#
# VERIFICATION:
#
#   python -c "from quantiq.backend import get_device_info;
#              print(get_device_info())"
#
#   Expected output should show:
#     {'backend': 'jax', 'device_type': 'gpu', ...}
#
# NOTES:
# - This uses conda-forge channel for all dependencies
# - jaxlib explicitly specified with CUDA support (*cuda* selector)
# - quantiq installed via pip after conda dependencies resolved
# - For CPU-only installation, use standard pip: pip install quantiq
#
# ========================================================

name: quantiq-gpu
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  # Python version (3.12 or 3.13)
  - python>=3.12,<3.14

  # JAX with GPU support (CRITICAL: *cuda* selector ensures GPU-enabled build)
  - "jaxlib=*=*cuda*"
  - jax>=0.8.0

  # Scientific computing stack
  - numpy>=2.3.4
  - scipy>=1.16.2
  - matplotlib>=3.10.7
  - pandas>=2.3.3

  # Bayesian inference (requires JAX)
  - numpyro>=0.19.0

  # CUDA libraries (managed by conda)
  # Typically auto-installed with jaxlib=*cuda*, but can be explicit
  # - cuda-libraries
  # - cudnn>=9.8,<10.0

  # Package managers
  - pip

  # Install quantiq from PyPI via pip after conda deps resolved
  # This ensures conda's CUDA-enabled jaxlib is preserved
  - pip:
      - quantiq

# Environment variables (optional, usually not needed with proper conda setup)
# If JAX detects wrong CUDA version, ensure LD_LIBRARY_PATH is NOT set
# variables:
#   LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ""
